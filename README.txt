a chess simulation of racing kings


player clicks on the piece to move it. The legal move squares(if any) light up. Clicking on one of the illuminated squares
completes or captures the move.

It's helpful to know the ground rules of chess, how the pieces move, etc, there are some key differences.

    The game ends when a king reaches the 8th square. The First player to reach the 8th square wins.
    The starting layout is different than oppositional/standard chess.
    There are no pawns on the board(consequently,pawn promotion is not an issue)
    As the kings' starting position is directly next to the rook, castling is also not an issue
    Check of any kind is illegal, so you may not move your king into check OR PLACE YOUR OPPONENT'S KING IN CHECK
